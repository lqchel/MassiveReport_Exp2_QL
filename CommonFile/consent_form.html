				Hello! Thank you for your interest in our study.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are interested to find out your general impression on some images that reflect day-to-day lives.
				You will see each image briefly <span style="font-weight: bold;">(less than half a second)</span>, then we will present you a series of small image patches, and 
				ask you whether or not each patch were part of the presented image. 
				
				After completing trials, we will ask you to complete a short questionnaire. 
			</p>

			<p>This experiment will take approximately 40 minutes of your time. Don't worry! Further instructions will be provided before the experiment starts, and you get three practice trials.</p>

			<p>All data will be kept confidential. If you have any question at this stage, please contact the investigators above.</p>
